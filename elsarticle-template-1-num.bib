abstract = {The spatial variation of seismic ground motion is an important con- sideration for the seismic design of elongated structures supported on extended foundations or on multiple supports. The temporal and spatial variability of seismic ground motion is effectively described by the frequency-wave number spectra, which provide information concerning the corresponding correlational characteristics of earthquake motions. Until now, the frequency-wave number spectra have only been inferred experimentally, for specific seismic events, using data from seismograph arrays. In this work, closed-form analytic expressions of the frequency-wave num- ber spectra are established. The corresponding seismic ground motion is produced by a seismic source located in an elastic half-space and characterized by a double couple. The model used considers the propagation of three-dimensional waves in an elastic half-space that are generated at a seismic source and their eventual re- flection at the ground surface. Analytic expressions for the frequency-wave number spectra are then derived for the three displacement components (two horizontal ones and one vertical) at the ground surface.},

abstract = {In this paper, the seismic ground motion is simulated as a stochastic wave according to its analytically derived frequency-wave number spectra. The simulation is performed using an extension of the spectral representation method, which considers that the simulated wave consists of the superposition of a number of plane waves having amplitudes consistent with the frequency-wave number spectra. On the other hand, the frequency-wave number spectra provide all the information concerning the correlational characteristics of ground motion. Therefore, the main characteristics of both the coherent component of ground motion (representation by plane waves) and the incoherent component of ground motion (representation by its cross-correlational characteristics) are described in the simulated wave. At this stage, the model used to obtain analytically the frequency-wave number spectra is relatively simple, considering the seismic source as a double couple (point source) located in an elastic half-space. In addition, the model considers the propagation of three-dimensional waves in the elastic half-space that are generated at the seismic source and their eventual reflection at the ground surface. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

abstract = {A methodology is presented for efficient and accurate modeling of correlated wind velocities along long span structures at a virtually infinite number of points. Currently, the standard approach is to model wind velocities as discrete components of a multivariate stochastic vector process, characterized by a Cross-Spectral Density Matrix. To simulate sample realizations of the vector process, the Spectral Representation Method is one of the most commonly used, which involves a Cholesky decomposition of the Cross-Spectral Density Matrix. However, it is a well-known issue that as the length of the structure, and consequently the size of the vector process, increases, this Cholesky decomposition breaks down numerically. Alternatively, this paper introduces the use of the frequency-wavenumber spectrum to model the wind velocities as a stochastic "wave", continuous in both space and time. This allows the wind velocities to be modeled at a virtually infinite number of points along the length of the structure. In this paper, the relationship between the Cross Spectral Density Matrix and the frequency-wavenumber spectrum is first examined. The frequency-wavenumber spectrum is then derived for wind velocities. Numerical examples are carried out demonstrating that the simulated wave samples exhibit the desired spectral and coherence characteristics. The efficiency of this method, specifically through the use of the Fast Fourier Transform, is also demonstrated.},

@article{Zhou2020,
abstract = {A methodology is proposed for efficient and accurate modeling and simulation of correlated non-Gaussian wind velocity time histories along long-span structures at an arbitrarily large number of points. Currently, the most common approach is to model wind velocities as discrete components of a stochastic vector process, characterized by a Cross-Spectral Density Matrix (CSDM). To generate sample functions of the vector process, the Spectral Representation Method is one of the most commonly used, involving a Cholesky decomposition of the CSDM. However, it is a well-documented problem that as the length of the structure – and consequently the size of the vector process – increases, this Cholesky decomposition breaks down numerically. This paper extends a methodology introduced by the second and fourth authors to model wind velocities as a Gaussian stochastic wave (continuous in both space and time) by considering the stochastic wave to be non-Gaussian. The non-Gaussian wave is characterized by its frequency–wavenumber (FK) spectrum and marginal probability density function (PDF). This allows the non-Gaussian wind velocities to be modeled at a virtually infinite number of points along the length of the structure. The compatibility of the FK spectrum and marginal PDF according to translation process theory is secured using an extension of the Iterative Translation Approximation Method introduced by the second and third authors, where the underlying Gaussian FK spectrum is upgraded iteratively using the directly computed (through translation process theory) non-Gaussian FK spectrum. After a small number of computationally extremely efficient iterations, the underlying Gaussian FK spectrum is established and generation of non-Gaussian sample functions of the stochastic wave is straightforward without the need of iterations. Numerical examples are provided demonstrating that the simulated non-Gaussian wave samples exhibit the desired spectral and marginal PDF characteristics.},

@article{Kaimal1972,
abstract = {The behaviour of spectra and cospectra of turbulence in the surface layer is described within the framework of similarity theory using wind and temperature fluctuation data obtained in the 1968 AFCRL Kansas experiments. With appropriate normalization, the spectra and cospectra are each reduced to a family of curves which spread out according to z/L at low frequencies but converge to a single universal curve in the inertial subrange. The paper compares these results with data obtained by other investigators over both land and water. Spectral constants for velocity and temperature are determined and the variability in the recent estimates of the constants is discussed. The high‐frequency behaviour is consistent with local isotropy. In the inertial subrange, where the spectra fall as n−5/3, the cospectra fall faster: u$\omega$ and $\omega$$\theta$ as n−7/3, and u$\theta$, on the average, as n−5/2. The 4/3 ratio between the transverse and longitudinal spectral levels is observed at wavelengths of the order of the height above ground under unstable conditions and at wavelengths of the order of L/10 under stable conditions. This lower isotropic limit is shown to be governed by the combined effects of shear and buoyancy on small‐scale eddies. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1972 Royal Meteorological Society},

@article{Shields2011,
abstract = {Some widely used methodologies for simulation of non-Gaussian processes rely on translation process theory which imposes certain compatibility conditions between the non-Gaussian power spectral density function (PSDF) and the non-Gaussian probability density function (PDF) of the process. In many practical applications, the non-Gaussian PSDF and PDF are assigned arbitrarily; therefore, in general they can be incompatible. Several techniques to approximate such incompatible non-Gaussian PSDF/PDF pairs with a compatible pair have been proposed that involve either some iterative scheme on simulated sample functions or some general optimization approach. Although some of these techniques produce satisfactory results, they can be time consuming because of their nature. In this paper, a new iterative methodology is developed that estimates a non-Gaussian PSDF that: (a) is compatible with the prescribed non-Gaussian PDF, and (b) closely approximates the prescribed incompatible non-Gaussian PSDF. The corresponding underlying Gaussian PSDF is also determined. The basic idea is to iteratively upgrade the underlying Gaussian PSDF using the directly computed (through translation process theory) non-Gaussian PSDF at each iteration, rather than through expensive ensemble averaging of PSDFs computed from generated non-Gaussian sample functions. The proposed iterative scheme possesses two major advantages: it is conceptually very simple and it converges extremely fast with minimal computational effort. Once the underlying Gaussian PSDF is determined, generation of non-Gaussian sample functions is straightforward without any need for iterations. Numerical examples are provided demonstrating the capabilities of the methodology. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The estimation of peak wind pressures is important in the reliability- and performance-based design for low-rise buildings. Typically, Davenport's formula is widely used to determine the peak factor if the pressure approximately follows Gaussian distribution. Recently, the moment-based Hermite polynomial model (HPM) is becoming popular to estimate the peak factor when the non-Gaussianity of wind pressure exists. However, their performances deserve further study based on the appropriate wind tunnel data. In this study, Davenport's formula and moment-based HPM are reviewed. The peak value of wind pressure is determined using very long time histories of wind pressure data to evaluate the performance of moment-based HPM and Davenport's formula. Results suggest that moment-based HPM should be adopted in the peak value estimation for wind pressures when the skewness and kurtosis of a process are sufficient to capture its non-Gaussian properties. Results also show that Davenport's formula may cause noticeable errors in the peak factor estimation for the wind pressure data close to Gaussian process while HPM provides a robust estimation for these data.},

The class of non-normal processes considered here concerns environmental loads, such as wind and wave loads, and associated structural responses. First, static transformation techniques are used to perform simulations of the underlying Gaussian time or autocorrelation sample. An optimization procedure is employed to overcome errors associated with a truncated Hermite polynomial transformation. This method is able to produce simulations which closely match the sample process histogram, power spectral density, and central moments through fourth order. However, it does not retain the specific structure of the phase relationship between frequency components, demonstrated by the inability to match higher order spectra. A Volterra series up to second order with analytical kernels is employed to demonstrate the bispectral matching made possible with memory models. A neural network system identification model is employed for simulation of output when measured system input is available, and also demonstrates the ability to match higher order spectral characteristics.

With the target statistical characteristics, i.e., probability density function (PDF) and power spectra density (PSD) in hand, massive simulations of non-Gaussian wind pressure can be carried out, which provides the peak factors or any desired fractile levels for design applications. Existing methods concerning the peak factors of wind pressure are briefly reviewed, and the fundamental basis and the simulation procedure of the HDSB approach are presented. The invocation of the inverse Johnson transformation in the HDSB approach enhances its applicability to the entire Pearson diagram, i.e., for all the softening and hardening stationary non-Gaussian processes with any combination of skewness and kurtosis. The efficacy of the HDSB approach in comparison with existing methods is demonstrated and verified by comparing the numerically simulated results with the directly observed data in long-duration wind tunnel tests, and with results from previous methods. The computational demand of the HDSB approach is favorable when compared to long-duration wind tunnel tests or model driven approaches. The proposed HDSB approach can serve as a building block for the development of a data-driven framework for efficiently simulating stationary non-Gaussian processes and estimating the extremes accurately.},

For computing the modes, compared with existing Galerkin-type and collocation-type methods, the proposed computational procedure totally removes the need of selecting the basis functions or collocation points and the quadrature points, which not only greatly enhances adaptivity, but also avoids solving large-scale eigenvalue problems. Moreover, by computing with higher-order cumulant functions, the new theoretical and algorithmic frameworks show great potential for representing general non-Gaussian non-homogeneous random fields. Three numerical examples, including a three-dimensional random field discretization problem, illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithmic framework.},

abstract = {An efficient stationary multivariate non-Gaussian simulation method is developed using spectral representation and third order Hermite polynomial translation. An approximate closed form relationship is employed to identify the Hermite translation parameters based on target skewness and kurtosis. This preserves a high degree of accuracy over the entire admissible range of the Hermite translation, and eliminates the need for iterative solution of the translation parameters. The Hermite PDF model is suitable for a wide range of strongly non-Gaussian stochastic process. In addition, an explicit bidirectional relationship between the target non-Gaussian and Gaussian correlation is developed to eliminate the need for iteration or numerical integration to identify the underlying Gaussian correlation. Examples apply the simulation method to both theoretical targets and experimental wind pressure data.},

@article{Chen2010,
abstract = {Slender long-span bridges exhibit unique features which are not present in short and medium-span bridges such as higher traffic volume, simultaneous presence of multiple vehicles, and sensitivity to wind load. For typical buffeting studies of long-span bridges under wind turbulence, no traffic load was typically considered simultaneously with wind. Recent bridge/vehicle/wind interaction studies highlighted the importance of predicting the bridge dynamic behavior by considering the bridge, the actual traffic load, and wind as a whole coupled system. Existent studies of bridge/vehicle/wind interaction analysis, however, considered only one or several vehicles distributed in an assumed (usually uniform) pattern on the bridge. For long-span bridges which have a high probability of the presence of multiple vehicles including several heavy trucks at a time, such an assumption differs significantly from reality. A new "semideterministic" bridge dynamic analytical model is proposed which considers dynamic interactions between the bridge, wind, and stochastic "real" traffic by integrating the equivalent dynamic wheel load (EDWL) approach and the cellular automaton (CA) traffic flow simulation. As a result of adopting the new analytical model, the long-span bridge dynamic behavior can be statistically predicted with a more realistic and adaptive consideration of combined loads of traffic and wind. A prototype slender cable-stayed bridge is numerically studied with the proposed model. In addition to slender long-span bridges which are sensitive to wind, the proposed model also offers a general approach for other conventional long-span bridges as well as roadway pavements to achieve a more realistic understanding of the structural performance under probabilistic traffic and dynamic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2010 ASCE.},

Global Positioning Systems (GPS) provide one answer to this challenge, with rapid advancements in the available sampling rates and tracking resolution. However, as a relatively new dynamic sensing technology, GPS performance must be thoroughly validated before its application in full scale. This paper details an experimental program with this aim, documenting the performance of a high-precision GPS in terms of its background noise and dynamic tracking ability, while providing position quality thresholds suitable for qualifying the accuracy of tracking in full scale. Given the performance observed in these studies, considerations for full-scale deployment are offered as well as an assessment of its efficacy in monitoring the dynamic motions of a tall building through the Chicago full-scale monitoring project.},

A generic empirical equation describing the development of the velocity profile over a flat board has been developed. Comparison with previous works with impinging jets and conventional boundary layer flow speed-up factors has been completed. Speed-up factors were similar at the crest of the embankment, but dropped off rapidly behind the crest compared with boundary layer flow.

@article{Zhou2003,
abstract = {Under the action of wind, tall buildings oscillate simultaneously in the alongwind, acrosswind, and torsional directions. While the alongwind loads have been successfully treated using quasi-steady and strip theories in terms of gust loading factors, the acrosswind and torsional loads cannot be treated in this manner, since these loads cannot be related in a straightforward manner to the fluctuations in the approach flow. Accordingly, most current codes and standards provide little guidance for the acrosswind and torsional response. To fill this gap, a preliminary, interactive database of aerodynamic loads is presented, which can be accessed by any user with Microsoft Explorer at the URL address http://www.nd.edu/;nathaz/. The database is comprised of high-frequency base balance measurements on a host of isolated tall building models. Combined with the analysis procedure provided, the nondimensional aerodynamic loads can be used to compute the wind-induced response of tall buildings. The influence of key parameters, such as the side ratio, aspect ratio, and turbulence characteristics for rectangular sections, is also discussed. The database and analysis procedure are viable candidates for possible inclusion as a design guide in the next generation of codes and standards.},

Following this methodology, sample functions of the stochastic process can be generated with great computational efficiency using a cosine series formula. These sample functions accurately reflect the prescribed probabilistic characteristics of the stochastic process when the number N of the terms in the cosine series is large. The ensemble-averaged power spectral density or autocorrelation function approaches the corresponding target function as the sample size increases. In addition, the generated sample functions possess ergodic characteristics in the sense that the temporally-averaged mean value and the autocorrelation function are identical with the corresponding targets, when the averaging takes place over the fundamental period of the cosine series. The most important property of the simulated stochastic process is that it is asymptotically Gaussian as N → ∞. Another attractive feature of the method is that the cosine series formula can be numerically computed efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform technique. The main area of application of this method is the Monte Carlo solution of stochastic problems in engineering mechanics and structural engineering. Specifically, the method has been applied to problems involving random loading (random vibration theory) and random material and geometric properties (response variability due to system stochasticity).}",

abstract = {This study deals with the importance of the co-spectral density of the horizontal and vertical turbulence components when predicting the wind-induced dynamic response of long-span bridges. The simultaneous measurements of turbulence and response accelerations of the Sotra Bridge are investigated. A turbulence model including the cross-spectral density of the horizontal and vertical components is fitted to the turbulence measurements. This turbulence model is used to predict the standard deviations of the wind-induced accelerations of the Sotra Bridge. The predicted response is compared to the measurements, and it is concluded that the predicted horizontal response is closer to the measured response values if the co-spectral density of the turbulence components are included. The vertical response was not affected by the co-spectral density of the horizontal and vertical turbulence components. It is concluded that the influence on the predicted response is observable, but the contribution is low compared to the overall uncertainty in the modelling of the wind field. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
